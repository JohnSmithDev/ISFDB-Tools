A list of tags/shelves/breadcrumbs/genres/sub-genres that are not relevant to
ISFDB.

NB: This will possibly not be used by any code elsewhere in this repo, but by
other projects that live elsewhere.  However, as it's very much tied to ISFDB,
it seems that this is a reasonable place for it to live.

TODO (maybe): Make this JSON for wider compatibility?  (So use " rather than ')

!!! Keep this all lower case and in alphabetic-ish order !!!
